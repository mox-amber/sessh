## Overview
Sessh is a web application that hopes to cultivate a network of musicians
within the UH system by providing them with the tools they need to start
muscician-to-musician connections. By using simple and effective design 
principals we aim to have an application with the following features:

* Creation of profiles including descriptions such as musical interests, goals, skills, etc.
* Profiles will contain access to musical works they produced with links to other work they
  were involved in.
* Search features that allow filtering based on preferences.
* Adding people to your regular sessions list.
* Notifications based on search terms.

## Development
To bring our application to life we used issue driven management practices through 
our github repository. Within the repository separate projects were created based
on milestones we expected to reach. Our milestones were then divided into issues 
divided amongst each member.

### Milestone 1
For milestone 1, our goal was to create and deploy a working version of our application.

You can view our [project board](https://github.com/mox-amber/sessh/projects/1)
if you would like to see how we divided our tasks.

### Milestone 2
